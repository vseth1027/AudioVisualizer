I tested libraries ofxAudioAnalyzer with plan to use the All Algorithms Example as a starting point for the project. I must now figure out how I would like the images to be displayed according to the audio values.

- Changed audio to play at the beginning of the app. 
- Modified draw to display the rms image as a circle.
- I was looking for a C++ equivalent of the Java Math.random() function and found the rand() function. I used that to have the rms image appear at random locations on the app.
