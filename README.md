# CS 126 FinalProject

This project was created using the openframeworks library and the openframeworks addons [ofxAudioAnalyzer](https://github.com/leozimmerman/ofxAudioAnalyzer/blob/master/README.md#audio-file-player), [ofxAudioDecoder](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxAudioDecoder), and ofxGui. The project was initially based off of the example-allAlgorithms from the ofxAudioAnalyzer addon. 

In order to run this project, one must download the openframeworks library as well as the addons ofxAudioAnalyzer and ofxAudioDecoder. Then, one must use the openframeworks project generator to generate the project by specifying the path to the project and selecting the three required addons. To run the project, one can open the project in Xcode (recommended) or run in the terminal using the makefile (sometimes encounters issues).
